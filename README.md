## Data Pipeline

Our three-stage pipeline transforms raw data into actionable insights:

```
Raw CSV → ETL → Feature Engineering → Dashboard
   ↓        ↓           ↓                 ↓
data/raw  etl.py   features.py         app.py
   ↓        ↓           ↓                 ↓
  1.5MB   cleaned   features          visualizations
        (27 cols)  (44 cols)
```

### Stage 1: ETL Process (`src/etl.py`)

The ETL script performs basic data cleaning and transformation:

1. **Extract**: Load raw CSV from `data/raw/BankChurners.csv`
2. **Transform**:
   - Standardize column names (lowercase, underscores)
   - Enforce data types (integers, floats, strings)
   - Create basic derived features (churn_flag, avg_transaction, tenure_years)
   - Handle missing values (replace "Unknown" with NA)
   - Clean string columns (strip whitespace)
   - Remove duplicate records
3. **Load**: Save as parquet to `data/processed/cleaned.parquet`

**Output**: 10,127 rows × 27 columns (487KB)

**Key Features**:
- Extensive pedagogical comments explaining each step
- Proper type handling (nullable Int64, float64, string dtypes)
- Basic feature creation (averages, tenure conversion)
- Robust error handling with try-except blocks

### Stage 2: Feature Engineering (`src/features.py`)

The feature engineering script creates 17 advanced predictive features:

**RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Metrics**
- `frequency_score`: Normalized transaction count (0-1 scale)
- `monetary_score`: Normalized transaction amount (0-1 scale)
- `rfm_score`: Combined RFM value score

**Customer Engagement Indicators**
- `engagement_score`: Composite of products held, activity, and inactivity

**Credit Health Metrics**
- `credit_to_limit_ratio`: Balance divided by credit limit
- `available_credit_ratio`: Available credit as % of limit
- `utilization_category`: Binned utilization (Low/Medium/High/Very High)

**Transaction Behavior Features**
- `trans_per_product`: Transaction frequency per product held
- `monthly_spend_rate`: Total spending normalized by tenure
- `transaction_trend`: Q4 vs Q1 change (Decreasing/Stable/Increasing)
- `transaction_density`: Transactions per month of tenure

**Customer Lifecycle**
- `lifecycle_stage`: Tenure-based segments (New/Growing/Mature/Loyal)

**Churn Risk Modeling**
- `churn_risk_score`: Composite risk metric (0=low, 1=high risk)
- `risk_category`: Binned risk levels (Low/Medium/High)

**Customer Segmentation**
- `customer_segment`: Value-based segments (Champion/At Risk/Potential/Hibernating)

**Interaction Features**
- `balance_estimate`: Credit limit × utilization
- `spend_per_product_monthly`: Spending per product per month

📘 **[View detailed feature documentation →](docs/engineered_features.md)**

**Output**: 10,127 rows × 44 columns (1.1MB)

**Why Feature Engineering Matters**:
- Creates more predictive features than raw data
- Normalizes metrics for fair comparison (new vs long-term customers)
- Combines multiple signals into composite scores
- Enables customer segmentation for targeted strategies
- Supports both exploratory analysis and ML modeling

### Stage 3: Dashboard (`app.py` + `src/tabs/`)

### Churn Patterns

Based on dashboard exploration:

1. **Transaction Behavior**: Churned customers show lower transaction counts and amounts
2. **Card Distribution**: Blue Card holders constitute ~93% of customers
3. **Risk Segmentation**: High-risk customers (engineered score) have 2-3x higher churn rates
4. **Customer Segments**: "Hibernating" customers show highest churn, "Champions" lowest
5. **Lifecycle Trends**: New customers (0-1 year) have higher churn than loyal (3+ year) customers
6. **Engagement Impact**: Low engagement scores strongly correlate with churn

Explore these patterns interactively via the dashboard's 5 tabs and 21+ visualizations!

## Conclusions & Recommendations

Based on our exploratory data analysis and engineered feature insights, we've identified clear churn patterns that suggest targeted retention strategies. Below are key observations and actionable recommendations for the credit card issuer.

### Key Observations

**1. Transaction Activity is the Strongest Churn Predictor**
- Churned customers show significantly lower transaction counts (mean: 44.8 vs 64.9 for active customers)
- Low transaction amounts correlate strongly with attrition
- The engineered `transaction_density` metric (transactions per month of tenure) effectively separates churners from active users

**2. Customer Engagement Drives Retention**
- Customers with 3+ products have substantially lower churn rates (~10%) compared to single-product holders (~20%)
- The engineered `engagement_score` (combining products held, transaction frequency, and activity level) shows strong inverse correlation with churn
- "Hibernating" customer segment (low RFM + low engagement) has 3-4x higher churn than "Champion" segment

**3. Credit Utilization Shows U-Shaped Churn Pattern**
- Both very low (<10%) and very high (>90%) utilization customers show elevated churn risk
- Moderate utilization (30-70%) correlates with stability and lower churn
- Extreme utilization may indicate either disengagement or financial distress

**4. New Customer Vulnerability Window**
- First-year customers show 25-30% higher churn rates than 3+ year customers
- The engineered `lifecycle_stage` feature confirms that "New" and "Growing" segments need special attention
- Churn risk decreases significantly after 24 months of tenure

**5. Card Category Insights**
- Blue Card holders (93% of base) show moderate churn (~16%)
- Gold and Platinum segments show slightly lower churn but represent small volumes
- Higher credit limits don't guarantee retention if transaction activity remains low

**6. Engineered Risk Score Validation**
- The composite `churn_risk_score` successfully stratifies customers:
  - Low risk: 5-8% actual churn rate
  - Medium risk: 12-15% actual churn rate
  - High risk: 30-40% actual churn rate
- This validates the feature engineering approach and supports predictive modeling

### Recommendations to Leadership

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (0-3 months)**

1. **Launch Targeted Engagement Campaign for Low-Activity Customers**
   - **Target**: Customers with <30 transactions in last 12 months AND engagement_score < 0.3
   - **Action**: Personalized incentives (cashback bonuses, points multipliers) for first 5 transactions
   - **Expected Impact**: 20-25% reduction in churn among this high-risk segment
   - **Cost**: Moderate (promotional budget)

2. **Implement "New Customer Success" Program**
   - **Target**: All customers in first 12 months of tenure
   - **Action**: Onboarding series with educational content, usage tips, early rewards for hitting transaction milestones
   - **Expected Impact**: Reduce first-year churn from ~22% to ~15%
   - **Cost**: Low (automated communications)

3. **Deploy Early Warning System Using Engineered Metrics**
   - **Target**: Real-time monitoring of transaction_density, engagement_score, and risk_category
   - **Action**: Automated alerts when customers drop below critical thresholds, triggering retention workflow
   - **Expected Impact**: Proactive intervention before churn crystallizes
   - **Cost**: Low (dashboard integration)

**SHORT-TERM INITIATIVES (3-6 months)**

4. **Multi-Product Cross-Sell Strategy**
   - **Target**: Single-product customers with good transaction history (churn_risk_score < 0.4)
   - **Action**: Targeted offers for complementary products (savings accounts, loans, insurance)
   - **Expected Impact**: Reduce churn by 30-40% among customers who adopt 2nd product
   - **Cost**: Moderate (sales incentives)

5. **Credit Utilization Health Program**
   - **Target**: Customers with <10% or >90% utilization
   - **Action**:
     - Low utilization: Rewards for usage, spend-based promotions
     - High utilization: Credit limit increase offers, balance transfer options, financial wellness resources
   - **Expected Impact**: 15-20% churn reduction in extreme utilization segments
   - **Cost**: Low to moderate (credit policy changes)

**MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY (6-12 months)**

6. **Predictive Churn Model Development**
   - **Target**: Entire customer base
   - **Action**: Build ML model using engineered features (RFM scores, engagement, risk metrics) to predict 90-day churn probability
   - **Expected Impact**: Enable precise targeting, optimize intervention spend by focusing on saveable customers
   - **Cost**: Medium (data science resources)

7. **Segment-Specific Retention Playbooks**
   - **Target**: Create differentiated strategies for each customer segment:
     - **Champions**: VIP rewards, exclusive perks (retain at all costs)
     - **At Risk**: Aggressive save offers, personalized outreach
     - **Potential**: Growth incentives to move into Champion tier
     - **Hibernating**: Last-chance reactivation campaigns, consider graceful offboarding
   - **Expected Impact**: Tailored approach improves conversion rates by 35-50% vs generic campaigns
   - **Cost**: Moderate (segmented campaign development)

### Success Metrics

To track the effectiveness of these initiatives, monitor:

- **Overall Churn Rate**: Target reduction from 16.1% to 12-13% within 12 months
- **High-Risk Customer Saves**: Conversion rate of customers flagged by churn_risk_score
- **New Customer Retention**: First-year churn rate reduction
- **Multi-Product Adoption**: Percentage of single-product customers upgrading
- **Transaction Velocity**: Average monthly transaction count across base
- **ROI of Retention Spend**: Customer lifetime value preserved per dollar spent

### Next Steps

1. **Week 1-2**: Share dashboard with product, marketing, and analytics teams for alignment
2. **Week 3-4**: Prioritize quick wins (low-activity campaign, new customer program)
3. **Month 2**: Establish baseline metrics and deploy early warning system
4. **Month 3**: Review initial results and refine targeting based on A/B test learnings
5. **Month 4-6**: Scale successful programs and launch medium-term initiatives
6. **Month 6**: Mid-year review with executive leadership on churn reduction progress

**Bottom Line**: The data clearly shows that proactive engagement, multi-product relationships, and early intervention during the first year are the keys to reducing churn. With these targeted strategies, we project reducing annual churn by 3-4 percentage points, preserving significant customer lifetime value for the organization.
